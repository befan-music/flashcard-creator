    },
    {
      "question": "What happens during the 'Identification' phase of a PRISMA systematic review?",
      "answer": "During the Identification phase, records are identified from databases and registers or other sources. Duplicate records are removed, records are marked as ineligible by automation tools, and records are removed for other reasons before screening begins."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens during the 'Screening' phase of a PRISMA systematic review?",
      "answer": "During the Screening phase, records are screened for relevance, with excluded records documented. Reports are then sought for retrieval, and those successfully retrieved move to eligibility assessment."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens during the 'Eligibility' phase of a PRISMA systematic review?",
      "answer": "During the Eligibility phase, retrieved reports are assessed against pre-defined eligibility criteria. Reports that don't meet criteria are excluded with specific reasons documented (Reason 1, Reason 2, etc.)."
    },
    {
      "question": "When are inclusion and exclusion criteria determined in a systematic review?",
      "answer": "Inclusion and exclusion criteria are determined after setting the research question, usually before the search is conducted. They set the boundaries for the systematic review."
